How It Works
Upon launch, the program offers three options:

Start new monitoring session – Enter a URL, duration, and interval to monitor.
Analyze existing log file – Review detailed stats from previous monitoring sessions.
List all log files – See available logs from previous runs.
Logs are saved in a Logs/ subfolder as JSON files. All stats can be analyzed later.
